# Hello-IT-world
I am an HR enthusiast, people person, looking to get in touch with professionals or tech enthusiasts. Would be happy to learn some coding myself, so hoping to learn many things from you. I am always open for a chat or I rarely refuse a good cup of coffee and a discussion on the extraordinary evolution of technology if we are at the same location;) And yes, I know I am not a developer YET, but I do know some nice things about innovation and where we are heading. My main driver: how extraordinary it is for HR to facilitate the innovations that change the world!
